# DetectOSC Privacy Policy

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how DetectOSC handles information when you use our object detection application ("DetectOSC" or the "App").

## Information Collection and Usage

### No Data Collection or Storage
DetectOSC does not collect, store, or transmit any user data to our servers. All data processing occurs locally on your device:

- Camera feeds are processed entirely on your device
- Photo library videos are accessed only with your permission and processed locally
- No images, videos, or detection results are uploaded to any servers
- No analytics or usage data is collected

### Camera and Photo Library Access
DetectOSC requires access to your device's cameras and photo library solely to provide its core object detection functionality. This access is used exclusively for local processing and is never used to collect or transmit your personal data.

## OSC Communication
When you choose to use the OSC communication feature:
- Object detection data is sent directly to the devices you specify
- This transmission occurs only when you initiate the connection
- The data includes only metadata about detected objects
- We do not monitor, intercept, or store any of this communication

## Third-Party Services
DetectOSC does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Children's Privacy
DetectOSC is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the App and updating the "Last Updated" date.
